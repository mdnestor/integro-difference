# integro-difference
Integro-difference equations (IDEs) define discrete time integral recursions. They are used in population biology to measure the spread of an invasive species with discrete reproduction periods. This module contains a numerical algorithm to simulate integro-difference equations, and to calculate their spreading speed and travelling wave speed.

# Installation
The module requires numpy and matplotlib. The primary class can be imported as follows:
```
from integro_difference import ide
```
