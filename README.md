# integro-difference
Integro-difference equations (IDEs) define discrete time integral recursions. They are used in population biology to measure the spread of an invasive species with discrete reproduction periods. This module contains a numerical algorithm to simulate integro-difference equations, and to calculate their spreading speed and travelling wave speed.
